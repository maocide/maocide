### You found my workshop. Welcome.

I'm a developer who believes in two things: FOSS and the power of a good loud FLAC collection. I build honest, no-bullshit software, forged in the quiet hours between midnight and dawn. Each project is proof that the best response to a broken system isn't to fight it, it's to build something better and leave it behind in the dust.

The code here doesn't just run; it haunts. It's the ghost of every "wrong" and every "shouldn't," made real line by line.
